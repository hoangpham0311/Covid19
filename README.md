Small European nations (Andorra, San Marino, Montenegro) experienced the highest proportional infection rates.

## 2. Countries With the Highest Total Death Counts

| Rank | Country                            | Total Deaths  |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- | ------------- |

## 📌 Key Conclusions

1. Infection Impact

- Small European states had the highest proportional infection levels (up to 17% of the entire population).
- Large populations like the United States showed high absolute case numbers but moderate infection percentages (~9.8%).

2. Pandemic Mortality

- Europe and North America recorded the greatest number of COVID-19 deaths.
- Mortality severity varied widely depending on healthcare capacity and outbreak timing.

3. Vaccination Success

- Microstates and wealthy nations led global vaccination efforts.
- Countries exceeding 70% vaccination coverage saw reduced fatality growth rates in later pandemic stages.

4. Overall Insight

Vaccination levels strongly correlate with improved outcomes. Regions with early, widespread vaccination saw better control of severe cases and deaths. Conversely, countries with lower healthcare resources or delayed vaccination rollout experienced greater mortality impact.
